# Alveus community website

This is a work-in-progress community page around the Alveus Sanctuary twitch stream and related content. The page is
currently hosted at https://www.alveus.gg/.

Main ideas:
- Content focused hub for viewers (new and old) independent of the platforms (twitch/youtube/instagram), while the official 
    website can be the official presentation of the Sanctuary not only towards viewer but also industry and other 
    interested parties.
- Possible Features:
  - Notifications for on-stream and off-stream content (stream segment changes, video releases, ig posts). #1
  - Let viewers explore alveus online with content about the ambassadors and facilities, structuring and linking existing content.
  - Schedule of planned content and events.
- Could be a platform for user-interactions with the Sanctuary like feeding ambassadors for donations etc.
- Could be a backend for other applications like the twitch extension.
